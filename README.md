## Introduction

ADC-Test is a project developed to verify the functionality and accuracy of the ADC on various microcontroller platforms. The code provided in this repository can be used to perform ADC tests, including sampling analog signals, converting them to digital values, and analyzing the results.

## Features

- **ADC testing**: Verify the performance of the ADC by sampling analog signals.
- **Accuracy assessment**: Evaluate the accuracy of ADC conversions under different conditions.
- **Platform compatibility**: Code examples for popular microcontroller platforms such as Arduino, AVR, STM32, etc.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started with Calculator_AVR, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

* AVR microcontroller development board.
* AVR development environment (e.g., AVR-GCC compiler).
